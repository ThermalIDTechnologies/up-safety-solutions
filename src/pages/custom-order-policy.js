            <strong>Overruns / Underruns</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Due to the difficulty of manufacturing to exact quantity
            requirements without sacrificing quality, a shipment of 5% over or
            under the quantity ordered will constitute a complete order.

            <strong>Changes / Cancellations</strong>

          <p>
            There will be no charge if order change or cancellation is received
            before work on art has begun. If received after artwork is
            completed, but before production has begun, a minimum of $75 will be
            billed. An order cannot be canceled if it has been produced.
