            Attention trademark and copyright attorneys representing others'
            intellectual property: There are those engaged in the intellectual

            industries have been servicing virtually every company's commercial

            that include a well-known trademarked logo of a real estate
            brokerage's franchise company, the print shop is unable to know if
            John Doe is or will remain a licensed real estate agent with the
            firm or will use the cards in a non-infringing manner. There are
            tens of thousands of real estate agencies and agents changing daily.

            <strong>XVI. General Information</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            The TOS constitute our entire agreement with you and govern your use
            of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between us. You
            also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may
            apply when you use affiliate services, or third-party content. These
            TOS and the relationship between us shall be governed by the laws of
            the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of law
            provisions. We collectively agree to submit to the personal and
            exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of
            Montgomery, Texas. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or
            provision of these TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right
            or provision. If any provision of these TOS is found by a court of
            competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree
            that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties'
            intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions
            of these TOS remain in full force and effect. You agree that
            regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause
            of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these
            TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of
            action arose or be forever barred.
            <br />

            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>XVII. Violations</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            Please report any violations of the TOS to our staff.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>XVIII. Color Matching</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            Digital proofs are provided upon request via email or the web. Color
            matching is done to the best of our ability. Due to the infinite
            configuration possibilities of end-user hardware and software, it is
            impossible to perfectly match the proof that is provided. All proofs
            are understood to be close representations of the printed product,
            and will inevitably have a certain degree of deviance from a
            monitor's image.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>XIV. Replacements</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            Under no circumstances will a refund be issued for any custom
            printed graphics. All graphics produced are completely custom, and
            are therefore only of value to the original purchaser. We may
            replace defective graphics if the original defective portion of the
            graphic is returned to us in its entirety. Defects are limited to
            faulty materials or workmanship. Products damaged in shipment or by
            third-party carriers are beyond the control of both us and our
            customers. Unless the carrier honors the claim for reimbursement in
            the event of damages, we cannot replace or refund any order or
            shipping and handling. Under no circumstances will installation
            error be considered a defect.
